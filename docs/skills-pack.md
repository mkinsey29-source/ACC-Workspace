# Mr. Mak agent skills

This pack contains 20 project-local workflows for Codex CLI and Claude Code.
You can use them in a game or creative project without installing Mr. Mak's
desktop app. Sign in to at least one of those CLIs first.

Read `docs/skills.md` for the complete index. The six new game workflows cover
VFX, UI, animation integration, levels, audio and native visual review. Existing
skills cover planning, handoffs, image/3D production, Blender animation, video
inspection, Workspace reports and local dictation setup.

## Add selected skills to a project

1. Extract the ZIP to a temporary folder. Keep your project files where they are.
2. Ask your agent to inspect the index and choose the skills useful for this
   project. Copy each whole folder from `.agents/skills/` for Codex or
   `.claude/skills/` for Claude. Use both if you use both agents.
3. Merge the required support files listed below. Preserve your own instructions,
   edited skills and report styles. Do not replace `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
   context, MCP configuration or existing Workspace cards.
4. Start a fresh CLI session in the project if newly added skills are not listed.
   Ask the agent to read the chosen `SKILL.md` and inspect your actual project
   before making changes.

Example request:

> Read the game-vfx-workflow skill, inspect our current combat events and game
> camera, and prepare a small shield-impact proposal. Keep gameplay unchanged.
> Show the selected layers, attachment, cancellation rules and native review plan.

## Support files

| Skill | Additional files or tools |
| --- | --- |
| Six game workflows, Blender animation, motion references | Keep the skill's own references. Bring the project's source assets and an available engine/editor connection for implementation. |
| Image and generation workflows | Keep any referenced sibling provider skill. Configure your own optional provider and read its current capabilities. |
| img2threejs | Copy its entire folder, including code, resources and Apache-2.0 licence. Optional upstream integrations remain separate. |
| workspace-authoring | `processes/workspace-authoring.md` and `workspace/_shared/{report.css,report.js,examples.css}`. Merge these with your own styles if needed. A report viewer/app is separate. |
| video-watch | `knowledge/video-watch.md`, `scripts/video-watch/` and the shared report assets. Install the optional Python requirements in a local virtual environment. |
| voice-dictation-setup | `knowledge/voice-dictation.md`. The dictation application and its model are separate installations. |
| Production routing | Choose and copy the relevant sibling skills from the index; a route name does not install that workflow. |

No generation is required to install the pack. Tools, accounts, API access,
Blender and Unity are not bundled. Review dependency requirements before running
a helper. For an offline first check, inspect a supplied local asset and prepare
a plan without submitting a paid job.

## What is included

Complete Codex and Claude skill copies, the support files above, licence notices,
